# Containers Module Refactoring Progress

## Completed Work

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Created domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation folders
   - Set up necessary subdirectories following clean architecture principles

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Created ContainerEntity in domain/entities
   - Defined Component interface for components
   - Created Kind enum for component types
   - Established constants for container types and registries

3. **Application Layer**
   - Created ContainerServiceInterface
   - Created WatcherEngineServiceInterface
   - Created ContainerLogsServiceInterface
   - Implemented ContainerService following clean architecture
   - Implemented WatcherEngineService with proper component management
   - Implemented ContainerLogsService for container log access
   - Created AbstractWatcherComponent and AbstractRegistryComponent base classes
   - Implemented ContainerComponentFactory for component creation

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Created ContainersController using dependency injection
   - Created ContainerLogsGateway for WebSocket communication
   - Added CreateContainerDto for request validation

5. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Added ContainerMapper for mapping between entities and documents
   - Implemented ContainerRepository with all required methods
   - Prepared updated containers.module.ts with clean architecture structure

## Next Steps

1. **Concrete Component Implementation**
   - Implement DockerWatcherComponent based on AbstractWatcherComponent
   - Implement ProxmoxWatcherComponent based on AbstractWatcherComponent
   - Implement various registry components based on AbstractRegistryComponent
   - Update component factory to use real implementations

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Add backward compatibility layers for older container usage patterns
   - Create appropriate adapter classes for legacy code

3. **Additional Functionality**
   - Implement remaining services (networks, volumes, images, stats)
   - Add remaining DTOs for request validation
   - Complete mappers for all entities

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for new components
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Create integration tests for component communication

5. **Documentation**
   - Document the new architecture
   - Add inline documentation for all new classes
   - Create migration guide for future component additions

## Implementation Notes

- The ContainerComponentFactory currently returns mock implementations
- The WatcherEngineService is implemented but relies on mock components
- ContainerLogsService includes placeholder code for log streaming
- Legacy repository methods are maintained for backward compatibility

## Migration Strategy

1. **Incremental Approach**
   - Keep current implementation working while gradually migrating
   - Implement one component at a time
   - Add comprehensive tests before refactoring

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Use interface adapters to maintain API compatibility
   - Ensure all public methods continue to work

3. **Testing Plan**
   - Unit test all migrated components
   - Integration test between components
   - System test for full functionality

## Implementation Notes

- The ContainerRepository interface already exists but needs to be updated
- Several interfaces already exist but need modifications
- The WatcherEngineService is the most complex part and requires careful migration
- The Docker component in watchers needs significant refactoring to follow clean architecture
