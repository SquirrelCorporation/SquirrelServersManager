# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING AND EXECUTING TESTS

- We use Vitest for testing. E.g to run a suite: `npx vitest run src/modules/ansible/__tests__`
- Tests should be under __tests__ at the basepath of each module (e.g: modules/devices/__tests__)
- Inside __tests__, the directories should mirror the module's.
E.g:
```
server/src/modules/ansible/__tests__/domain 
server/src/modules/ansible/__tests__/application/services 
server/src/modules/ansible/__tests__/infrastructure/repositories 
server/src/modules/ansible/__tests__/presentation/controllers
```
- tests should be prefixed with .spec.ts
- package.json for the server project is located at `/server/package.json`. package.json for the client project is located at `/client/package.json`
