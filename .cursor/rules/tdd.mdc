- **Write tests before implementing new features or bug fixes**
  - Every new line of code must be accompanied by a corresponding test written first
  - Tests should be committed before or with the implementation
- **Follow the architecture and style of existing tests**
  - Use the same test frameworks, patterns, and directory structure as current tests
  - Reference actual test files for examples (e.g., `__tests__` directories, `*.spec.ts` files)
- **Test Coverage**
  - New code should not decrease overall test coverage
  - Edge cases and error handling must be tested
- **Examples**
  ```typescript
  // âœ… DO: Write a failing test before implementing a new service method
  it('should return the correct result for valid input', async () => {
    // Arrange
    // ...
    // Act
    // ...
    // Assert
    // ...
  });
  // Then implement the method to make the test pass
  ```
