# Obsolete Code - For Reference Only

This directory contains the original implementation of the Containers module before the clean architecture refactoring.

These files are kept for reference purposes during the transition but should not be imported or used in new code.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT import or use these files in new code!**

## Clean Architecture Migration

The Containers module has been refactored to follow clean architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and service interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External implementations (databases, APIs)
- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, DTOs, and gateways

Please use the new implementations in their respective layer directories.

## Migration Timeline

- Started: Q1 2025
- Target completion: Q2 2025

## Questions

If you have questions about the migration or need help updating your code, please contact the architecture team.
