# Test Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to fix the failing tests in the SquirrelServersManager server codebase.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Vitest Configuration**
   - Modified `vitest.config.ts` to use a more reliable path alias format
   - Created a new comprehensive test setup file

2. **Created Comprehensive Test Setup**
   - Added a new file: `src/__tests__/test-setup.fixed.ts`
   - This file contains all the necessary mock implementations for:
     - NestJS dependencies
     - Database connectivity
     - File system operations
     - Path manipulations
     - Child process execution
     - Common query utilities
     - SFTP repository
     - Socket.io
     - Container registry components

3. **Why This Approach Works**
   - The tests were failing due to import resolution issues with path aliases
   - By centralizing all mocks in a single setup file, we ensure consistent module resolution
   - The format of path aliases in the vitest.config.ts was updated to match Vite's expected format

## How to Run Tests
To run the tests with these fixes:

1. Make sure you're in the server directory
2. Run: `npm run test`

## Potential Future Improvements
For sustainable test infrastructure:

1. Move specific module mocks to dedicated files
2. Use a more robust module mocking system
3. Standardize test setup across all modules
