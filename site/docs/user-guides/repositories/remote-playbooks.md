## Synchronization

- SSM **will not** listen to changes (addition/deletion) made outside its interface unless a manual synchronization is triggered.
- Any changes made **inside** SSM will be automatically synchronized.
  If you believe SSM is desynchronized from the actual file structure of the repository, click on `...` of the `Actions` button of the Repository modal, and click on `Sync to database`

## Delete a remote repository

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive action
This action is permanent. Deleting a remote repository will effectively delete the underlying files and directories permanently. Proceed with caution!

:::info Volume path
By default, according to the docker-compose.yml, remote playbooks are stored on your filesystem thanks to a Docker volume `./.data.prod/playbooks:/playbooks`, meaning the files will be located locally on your system in `./.data.prod/playbooks/`
