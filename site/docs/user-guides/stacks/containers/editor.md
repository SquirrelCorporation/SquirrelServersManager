## Overview

SSM is one of the few, if not the only one, to offer a Docker Compose visual stack editor.
The UI builder is context-aware of your setup, meaning it will autocomplete existing networks, images, dependencies, or volumes across multiple devices.

### Adding a New Stack

You can compose a new Docker Compose stack visually by dragging and dropping elements and filling them in, or directly edit the code in the code editor.

SSM will automatically translate your UI stack to code. To see the generated code, just click `Switch to Code Editor`.

### Validate

Validate your code by clicking on `Check format`. Basic validation checks will be performed so you know if your code is at least syntactically correct.

### Templates
A selection of templates is available for most used services
