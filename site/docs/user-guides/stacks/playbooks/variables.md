- **MANUAL Variables**: Manually entered before execution.

- **Adding Variables**:
    - Use the configuration tab and `+` icon in the playbook.
    - Select the type, enter new or existing variable name, and provide values if needed.

## Variable Types

SSM introduces three types of variables to include in your playbooks:

|  Variable   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CONTEXT** | A variable that is automatically filled by SSM during the run of the playbook.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **SHARED**  | A variable stored in the database, available across playbooks and sharing the same value. It can be overridden for a process by entering a custom value. You can also change the saved value globally by clicking the `Overwrite` button in dedicated places. |
| **MANUAL**  | This variable is filled manually before each execution or can be defined when creating an automation.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Adding a Variable to a Playbook

You can add and share ExtraVars across playbooks. When a playbook is opened, click on the configuration tab above it, then click on the `+` icon on the top right side.

Select a type, then enter a new name or select the name of an existing ExtraVar. Depending on the type of variable, you may need to enter a value.

### Variable Options

|  Variable   |      Value       | Details                                                                        |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CONTEXT** |   :red_circle:   | Automatically filled by SSM at runtime                                         |
| **SHARED**  | :orange_circle:  | Not required if the variable already exists. Can be overridden for all playbooks |
| **MANUAL**  | :orange_circle:  | Will be entered before running a playbook                                      |

Setting a variable as `required` will make the variable mandatory before running a playbook. Ansible playbook execution will fail if a required variable is not defined, unless you set a default value:

```yaml
- name: Uninstall agent on targeted device
  vars:
    agent_log_path: "{{ _ssm_agentLogPath | default(omit) }}"
```

## CONTEXT Variables

|  Variable         | Description                           |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------|
| `_ssm_deviceId`   | Internal SSM UUID of the device       |
| `_ssm_deviceIP`   | The device's last known IP address    |
| `_ssm_agentLogPath` | The path of the agent log directory  |
