# Manually Installing the Agent


:::warning Deprecation notice
Agents are deprecated >= 0.1.28.

SSM is **agentless** by default. However, they may be some particular cases where installing an agent may be useful.


If you have difficulties installing the agent from the UI, you can install it manually on the device.

## NodeJS Vanilla Agent

### Environment
It is possible to customize the behavior of the agent by setting environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Env                             | Required |         Example         | Description                                                | 
|---------------------------------|:--------:|:-----------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `URL_MASTER`                    |   YES    | http://192.168.0.3:8000 | URL of the SSM API                                         |
| `OVERRIDE_IP_DETECTION`         |    NO    |       192.168.0.1       | Disable the auto-detection of the IP and set a fixed value |
| `AGENT_HEALTH_CRON_EXPRESSION`  |    NO    |     '*/30 * * * * *'    | Frequency of agent self-check                              |
| `STATISTICS_CRON_EXPRESSION`    |    NO    |     '*/30 * * * * *'    | Frequency of stats push                                    |

### Method 1: Installing the Agent with the Provided Shell Script
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SquirrelCorporation/SquirrelServersManager-Agent
cd ./SquirrelServersManager-Agent
```

Replace `MASTER_NODE_URL` below with the URL to your SSM installation:
```shell
./install.sh -a -u MASTER_NODE_URL
```

Please note that this method will **create** a device in SSM.
If the device has already been added or a device with the same IP already exists, the agent will fail to start.
If the device already exists in SSM, use:
```shell
./install.sh -a -u MASTER_NODE_URL -s DEVICE_ID
```
and replace `DEVICE_ID` with the UUID of the device in SSM (In Inventory, click on the IP and copy the UUID shown in the right drawer).

### Method 2: Building & Installing the Agent Manually
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SquirrelCorporation/SquirrelServersManager-Agent
cd ./SquirrelServersManager-Agent
```

```shell
vim .env
```

Edit the **API_URL_MASTER** value with the URL of SSM.

```shell
npm install
npm build
```

Please note that this method will **create** a device in SSM.
If the device has already been added or a device with the same IP already exists, the agent will fail to start.
If the device already exists in SSM, create a `hostid.txt` file containing the UUID of the device in SSM.

You can now start the agent manually:
```shell
node ./build/agent.js
```

However, you will need some kind of service scheduler so the agent is monitored and starts at startup.
We recommend using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/):
```shell
pm2 start -f ./build/agent.js
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Dockerized Agent

### Environment
It is possible to customize the behavior of the agent by setting environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Env                             | Required |         Example         | Description                                                | 
|---------------------------------|:--------:|:-----------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `URL_MASTER`                    |   YES    | http://192.168.0.3:8000 | URL of the SSM API                                         |
| `OVERRIDE_IP_DETECTION`         |    NO    |       192.168.0.1       | Disable the auto-detection of the IP and set a fixed value |
| `AGENT_HEALTH_CRON_EXPRESSION`  |    NO    |     '*/30 * * * * *'    | Frequency of agent self-check                              |
| `STATISTICS_CRON_EXPRESSION`    |    NO    |     '*/30 * * * * *'    | Frequency of stats push                                    |
| `HOST_ID_PATH` |    NO    |      `/data/`     | Path where is stored the registered HostID                                    |
| `LOGS_PATH` |    NO    |      `/data/logs`     | Path where are store the logs                                    |
| `HOST_ID` |    NO    |     xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx    | UUID of the registered Device in SSM                                  |
