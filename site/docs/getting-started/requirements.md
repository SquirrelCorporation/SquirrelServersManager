# System Requirements

:::tip In a Nutshell (üå∞)
- Host system needs Docker 20.10+ with Docker Compose V2, 2GB RAM, and 10GB disk space
- Target devices need SSH access and appropriate capabilities (Docker, Proxmox API, etc.)
- Network requirements include port 8000 open for the web interface
- Modern browsers required: Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+
- MongoDB requires AVX CPU support by default (can be disabled)

## Overview

Squirrel Servers Manager (SSM) is designed to run efficiently on a wide range of systems, leveraging Docker for easy deployment and an agentless architecture for managing remote devices. This page outlines the system requirements for both the host system running SSM and the target devices being managed.

    ]
  }
]" />

## Host System Requirements

The host system is where you'll install SSM. This can be a physical server, virtual machine, or container host.

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU       | 2 cores with AVX* | 4+ cores with AVX |
| RAM       | 2 GB    | 4+ GB       |
| Disk Space | 10 GB  | 20+ GB      |
| Network   | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps     |

\* See [MongoDB AVX workaround](#mongodb-avx-workaround) if your CPU doesn't support AVX instructions.

### Software Requirements

| Software | Version | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Docker   | 20.10+  | Needed for container management |
| Docker Compose | V2 | Required for orchestrating the SSM containers |
| Operating System | Linux-based | Docker on Windows/macOS is supported but may have limitations |

## Target Device Requirements

Target devices are the servers or systems you want to manage with SSM. Since SSM uses an agentless architecture, there's no need to install software on these devices.

### Basic Requirements (All Devices)

- SSH access (password or key-based authentication)
- User with sudo/root privileges
- Network connectivity between SSM host and target device

## Storage Requirements

SSM's storage requirements vary based on the number of devices managed, containers deployed, and monitoring data retained.

## Advanced Topics

### MongoDB AVX Workaround {#mongodb-avx-workaround}

Modern MongoDB versions require CPUs with AVX instructions. If your CPU doesn't support AVX, you can use an older MongoDB version by modifying your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.4.18  # Use this older version that doesn't require AVX
```

### Reducing Resource Usage

For low-resource environments, you can modify resource limits in your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
  client:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M
```

### Air-Gapped Environments

SSM can operate in air-gapped environments with some limitations:
- Pre-download all needed container images
- Disable automatic updates
- Set up local container registries if needed
- Prepare any required Ansible collections in advance
