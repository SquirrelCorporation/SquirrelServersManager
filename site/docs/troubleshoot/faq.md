# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are answers to some of the most common questions about Squirrel Servers Manager (SSM):

## How is SSM different from other server managers?
SSM is agentless and uses SSH for all device management—no extra software is required on your servers. It focuses on simplicity, security, and modern UI/UX, with built-in support for Docker, Ansible, and automation.

## Can SSM work offline?
Yes! SSM can manage your infrastructure without an internet connection, as long as your SSM server can reach your devices over the network via SSH.

## Is SSM open source?
Absolutely. SSM is fully open source and welcomes community contributions. You can find the code and contribute on GitHub.

## What platforms are supported?
SSM is designed to manage Linux servers and containers, but can run on any system that supports Docker. The web UI works in all modern browsers.
