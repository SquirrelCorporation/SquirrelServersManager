:::tip üå∞ In a Nutshell
- SSM implements a comprehensive security model for device management
- Credentials are securely stored with encryption
- Role-based access controls (RBAC) protect sensitive operations
- SSH provides secure device connections with strict key verification
- No permanent agents run on managed devices, reducing the attack surface

## Security First Approach

Squirrel Servers Manager (SSM) was designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines the security model used throughout the system to protect your infrastructure.

## Credential Management

### Secure Storage

SSM uses several layers of security to protect sensitive credentials:

- **Ansible Vault Encryption**: SSH keys and passwords are encrypted using Ansible Vault
- **Database Encryption**: Credentials stored in MongoDB use additional encryption
- **Memory Safety**: No permanent storage of plain-text secrets in memory

### SSH Key Management

When using SSH keys for device authentication:

- Keys can be generated by SSM or imported from existing keys
- Private keys are encrypted before storage
- Key passphrase support for additional security
- Keys are only decrypted in memory when needed for connections

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

SSM implements secure user authentication:

- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Password complexity requirements
- Protection against brute force attacks
- Session management with configurable expiration

### Role-Based Access Control

RBAC protects sensitive operations:

- Admin users have full system access
- Regular users have limited permissions
- Permissions for device management, container operations, and playbook execution can be customized
- Actions are logged for audit purposes

## Network Security

### SSH Connection Security

All device connections use secure SSH:

- Strict host key verification prevents MITM attacks
- Connections close after command execution
- No permanent open ports on managed devices
- Support for non-standard SSH ports

### Connection Encryption

SSM ensures all connections are encrypted:

- SSH connections use industry-standard encryption
- WebSocket connections use TLS when configured with a proxy

## Agentless Security Benefits

The agentless architecture provides significant security advantages:

- No permanent agents running on target devices
- Lower attack surface with fewer components to exploit
- No need to maintain agent security patches
- No root-level services required on managed devices

## Security Best Practices

When deploying SSM, follow these security best practices:

### Access Control

- Create individual user accounts rather than sharing credentials
- Use the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
- Regularly review user access and permissions

### Network Configuration

- Deploy behind a reverse proxy for TLS termination if public access is required
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to the SSM server
- Consider network segmentation to isolate management traffic

### Credential Management

- Use SSH keys instead of passwords where possible
- Generate unique SSH keys for SSM rather than sharing existing keys
- Implement a key rotation policy for sensitive environments
