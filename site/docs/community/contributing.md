## Finding Issues to Work On

<RequirementsGrid :requirements="[
  { header: 'Good First Issues', items: ['Small scope', 'Clear requirements', 'Labeled in GitHub', 'Good for beginners'] },
  { header: 'Feature Requests', items: ['Add new capabilities', 'Enhancement requests', 'UI/UX improvements', 'Performance optimizations'] },
  { header: 'Bug Fixes', items: ['Fix reported issues', 'Improve stability', 'Address edge cases', 'Solve usability problems'] },
  { header: 'Documentation', items: ['Fix typos/errors', 'Add missing information', 'Create tutorials', 'Improve existing guides'] }
]" />

We recommend starting with these types of issues:

1. Issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/SquirrelCorporation/SquirrelServersManager/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
2. Documentation improvements
3. Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
4. Features you personally need or would use

## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Create a branch for your contribution with a descriptive name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-contribution
```

Use these branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation changes
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### Code Style Guidelines

SSM follows specific code style guidelines to maintain code quality and consistency:

<details>
<summary>TypeScript/JavaScript Style Guide</summary>

- **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, LF line endings, single quotes
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, decorators
  - camelCase for variables, functions, methods
  - ALL_CAPS for constants
- **Code Structure**:
  - Limit function size (< 50 lines recommended)
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Add comments for complex logic
- **Types**:
  - Use strict typing with interfaces and types
  - Avoid `any` type when possible
  - Define return types for functions
- **Testing**:
  - Write tests for new features
  - Cover edge cases
  - Aim for high code coverage
</details>

<details>
<summary>Server-Side Guidelines</summary>

- **NestJS Architecture**:
  - Follow the module pattern
  - Use dependency injection
  - Implement interfaces for services
  - Apply proper validation using DTOs
- **Module Encapsulation**:
  - Only export services, never repositories
  - Access functionality through service interfaces
  - Use tokens for injection (e.g., `DEVICES_SERVICE`)
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use standardized exception types
  - Include relevant context in errors
  - Follow the API error response format
</details>

<details>
<summary>Client-Side Guidelines</summary>

- **React Patterns**:
  - Use functional components with hooks
  - Implement proper state management
  - Follow Ant Design Pro patterns
  - Use composition over inheritance
- **UI/UX**:
  - Follow the existing design system
  - Ensure responsive design
  - Maintain accessibility standards
  - Consider performance impact
</details>

- [Server CODE_GUIDELINES.md](https://github.com/SquirrelCorporation/SquirrelServersManager/blob/master/server/CODE_GUIDELINES.md)

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, ensure they pass all tests:

```bash
# Run server tests
cd server
npm run test

# Run client tests
cd client
npm run test

# Run linting checks
npm run lint:check
```

Fix any issues that arise from these checks.

## Submitting Changes

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Ensure your code passes all tests and checks
2. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-contribution
   ```
3. Visit your fork on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button
4. Fill out the PR template with a clear description of your changes

### PR Description Best Practices

Write a descriptive pull request that:

- Clearly explains what your changes do
- References any related issues (`Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`)
- Includes before/after screenshots for UI changes
- Lists any breaking changes or migrations required
- Mentions any testing you've done

### Code Review Process

After submitting your PR:

1. Automated CI/CD checks will run on your code
2. Maintainers will review your changes
3. Address any feedback or requested changes
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

<PlatformNote platform="Pull Request Tips">
- Keep PRs focused on a single concern
- Break large features into smaller PRs
- Respond promptly to review comments
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Update your PR based on review feedback
</PlatformNote>

### Documentation Best Practices

- Use clear, concise language
- Include screenshots for UI features
