## <span style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img src="/images/about-goal.svg" alt="tldr" style="margin-right: 8px;" /> Why build SSM?</span>

I couldn't find any tools for my homelab that allowed me to manage my 5 Raspberry Pis and 3 Ubuntu servers with a nice UI. So, I decided to code it!

## <span style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img src="/images/about-squirrel.svg" height="30px" width="30px" alt="tldr" style="margin-right: 8px;" />Why Squirrel?</span>

Consider all your devices as nuts üå∞üå∞üå∞. A squirrel üêø loves to gather them all in some hole in a tree. That's what we are doing here! Also, squirrels are cute!

SSM is still in its early stages. I have a lot of ground to cover, and I won't be able to do this without help from community contributors. I am also actively looking for more team members with long-term commitment.
