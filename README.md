## Disabling Anonymized Telemetry

By default, SSM automatically reports anonymized basic usage statistics. This helps us understand how SSM is used and track its overall usage and growth. This data does not include any sensitive information. To disable anonymized telemetry, follow these steps:

Set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` to `false` in your `.env` file.

# Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to run pre-commit checks. Before each commit:
- The project will be built
- All tests will be run

This ensures that no broken code is committed to the repository.

## Setup

The hooks will be installed automatically when you run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Skipping Hooks

In rare cases where you need to skip the pre-commit checks (not recommended), you can use:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
Or uncheck "Run Git hooks" in WebStorm's commit dialog.
