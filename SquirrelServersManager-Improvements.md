# SquirrelServersManager: Improvement Action Plan

This document outlines detailed action plans for improving several areas of the SquirrelServersManager codebase, focusing on standardizing error handling, enhancing test coverage, addressing technical debt, refining module architecture, strengthening security, and optimizing performance.

## 1. Standardize Error Handling

**Current Status:** The codebase uses both a NestJS exception filter (`HttpExceptionFilter`) and a custom error system (`ApiError` hierarchy).

**Goal:** Establish a single, consistent error handling pattern across all modules.

### Action Items

- [ ] **Create a new unified error handling framework**
   - [ ] Create a new `ErrorHandlingModule` that uses NestJS exception filters
   - [ ] Design a response format that maintains backward compatibility with existing APIs
   - [ ] Implement HTTP exception filters that maintain the current response format
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions extending NestJS `HttpException` for each error type

- [ ] **Implement exception mappers**
   - [ ] Create mappers to convert between legacy `ApiError` types and new NestJS `HttpException` types
   - [ ] Develop interceptors to ensure consistent response formats

- [ ] **Gradual migration plan**
   - [ ] Start with high-activity modules (e.g., DevicesModule, ContainersModule)
   - [ ] Add the new error handling approach to new modules first
   - [ ] Refactor existing modules during regular maintenance
   - [ ] Create a bridge mechanism to support both error formats during transition

- [ ] **Documentation and standards**
   - [ ] Document the new error handling approach in `CODE_GUIDELINES.md`
   - [ ] Create examples for common error scenarios
   - [ ] Update test utilities to support the new error handling

   - [ ] Ensure all error responses include:
     - [ ] HTTP status code
     - [ ] Error code/type
     - [ ] Human-readable message
     - [ ] Optional contextual data
   - [ ] Add logging for all exceptions with appropriate context
   - [ ] Implement global exception handling for unhandled errors
